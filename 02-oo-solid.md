# Object-Oriented Programming Recap and SOLID Principles

## OOP Recap
- **Encapsulation:** Bundling data with methods that operate on it.
- **Inheritance:** Deriving classes from existing ones.
- **Polymorphism:** Ability to process objects differently based on their type.

## SOLID Principles

1. **S - Single Responsibility:** A class should have one and only one reason to change.
2. **O - Open/Closed:** Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification.
3. **L - Liskov Substitution:** Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types.
4. **I - Interface Segregation:** No client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use.
5. **D - Dependency Inversion:** High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules.

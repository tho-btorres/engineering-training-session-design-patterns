# Introduction to Design Patterns

Design patterns provide reusable solutions to common problems in software design. They are broadly categorized as:

1. **Creational Patterns:** Deal with object creation (e.g., Builder, Singleton).
2. **Behavioral Patterns:** Focus on object interaction and responsibility delegation (e.g., Strategy, Chain of Responsibility).
3. **Structural Patterns:** Concerned with object composition and relationships (e.g., Adapter, Composite).
